# # ERA5 → 12 km land-coupled, convection-permitting hindcast (Breeze + NestedModel + SlabLand)
#
# A limited-area model (LAM) example that downscales ERA5 reanalysis to a ~12 km Breeze compressible
# atmosphere over the U.S. Southern Great Plains, for the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds
# Experiment (MC3E) 20 May 2011 squall-line case ([Fan2017](@citet)) — with an interactive `SlabLand`
# surface under the child and all-sky RRTMGP radiation heating the column and the surface, so the
# diurnal cycle, the clouds, and the land talk to each other.
#
# `nested_atmosphere_model(grid, dataset; dates, …)` builds the whole nest: an ERA5 "parent"
# `PrescribedAtmosphere` on its native 0.25° pressure-level grid, driving a Breeze "child" through open
# lateral boundary conditions + interior Davies relaxation, both derived on the fly from the parent's
# raw state. The constructor also initializes the child from the reanalysis and spins it into balance,
# so a plain `Simulation(model)` then steps the ready nest.
#
# ## What this example does
# - Downloads ERA5 (pressure + single levels) and regrids it onto a terrain-following
#   `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` (ETOPO2022 orography, blended to the parent's at the boundary).
# - Initializes the prognostic state from ERA5 with a hydrostatic-from-surface pressure, a
#   terrain-consistent `w̃ ≈ 0`, and a dynamical-initialization (DFI) pass that balances `ρw`.
# - Integrates the compressible equations with split-explicit acoustic substepping, 1-moment
#   mixed-phase microphysics, Coriolis, and Rayleigh damping.
# - Couples an interactive `SlabLand` (prognostic skin temperature + bucket hydrology) under the
#   child through Monin–Obukhov similarity fluxes, and the child's rain into the land bucket.
# - Runs all-sky RRTMGP radiative transfer inside the child — interior heating rates on the
#   evolving clouds, observed (CGLS 1 km) surface albedo, surface fluxes into the land energy
#   budget, and the interface skin temperature closing the longwave loop.
# - Writes and animates horizontal slices, a vertical section, and the land-surface response.
#
# ## What it does NOT do (yet)
# - Single nest only (ERA5 → 12 km; coarsened 4× from Fan's 3 km Domain 3 for a fast configuration).
# - The land is a slab: no soil column, no vegetation, and no boundary-layer or cumulus
#   parameterization — diffusion is numerical, and deep convection is resolved on the grid.
# - Snow does not reach the bucket yet (the coupler diagnoses the child's surface rain flux,
#   but no snow analog); immaterial for this warm-season case.

# ## Build the nest
#
# `nested_atmosphere_model(grid, dataset; dates, …)` derives the parent region from the child grid
# (padded by two native ERA5 cells), loads the parent `PrescribedAtmosphere` on ERA5's native
# pressure-level grid, anchors the default split-explicit compressible dynamics at the domain-mean
# ERA5 surface pressure, derives the parent-driven lateral BCs + Davies relaxation (cosine ramp over
# `relaxation_width` cells), materializes the blended `terrain`, and wraps parent + child in a
# `NestedModel` whose `time_step!` advances the child then ticks the parent clock.

# Time window: a `(start, end)` tuple — the hourly forcing cadence is the dataset's own. The initial
# outer time step is gentle (the adaptive wizard below ramps it). The Davies relaxation is an *explicit*
# nudge `dφ/dt = −r(φ − φₚₐᵣₑₙₜ)`, stable only for `r·Δt ≲ 2`, so its rate is a fixed `1/300 s⁻¹` — small
# enough that `r·Δt` stays well below 1 even at the wizard's `max_Δt`, rather than tied to Δt (which would
# climb into the over-relaxation regime as Δt grows). Momentum uses a narrower `WENO(5)` stencil, which
# interacts less violently with the open-boundary halo than the default `WENO(9)`.
